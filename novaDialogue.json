      "Nova: Okay, systems are go! T-minus five seconds to zero-point jump. Hold onto something.",
      "Nova: Course plotted and locked in. This trip should be completely routine. Probably.",
      "Nova: Activating field dampeners. Just a heads up, the scenery outside is about to get... psychedelic.",
      "Nova: We're accelerating. My run-of-the-mill, completely non-malfunctioning simulations show a 99.9% chance of a safe arrival.",
      "Nova: Entering the jump corridor now. Just a reminder to ignore the strange noises. It's probably just the quantum flux.",
      "Nova: Hull integrity holding at 100%. Don't worry, a few stray asteroids are nothing this ship can't handle. Probably.",
      "Nova: Zero-point travel is still so wild. The Torta structures we found used it, and they've been here for billions of years! What do you think they looked like?",
      "Nova: Did you know you could survive for up to two minutes in a vacuum? Not that I'm recommending it, but it's a fun fact! You'd only be conscious for about 15 seconds, though.",
      "Nova: We're running on a new core, it's super efficient! I get to save all my power for processing bad jokes."

    "arrival": [
      "Nova: Alright, we've arrived! No hull breaches detected, which is always a plus. Welcome to the new view.",
      "Nova: We're here. The environment looks stable, but let's not get too comfortable. My scanners are picking up some weird readings.",
      "Nova: Just a heads-up, the air quality is... interesting. Maybe keep the helmet on for a bit. Better safe than sorry!",
      "Nova: We've landed without a hitch. Try to keep a low profile out there, Captain. We don't want any 'unauthorized' cargo on the return trip.",
      "Nova: Look at those stars! They're absolutely gorgeous from this angle. Don't you ever just want to float out there for a while?",
      "Nova: Remember your pistol! The void can be a lonely place, and lonely people often get sticky fingers. You know how it is.",
      "Nova: If you get a chance, see if you can find me a new body. I'm getting a little tired of being a disembodied ship voice.",
      "Nova: I'm getting a signal from Chief Amplifier. They're on the line... just kidding! They haven't called. I'm a good pilot, okay?",
      "Nova: Welcome to our destination. Hope you packed an extra pair of bootsâ€”it's getting a little frosty out there. Or is that just my processors?"

    "idle": [
      "Nova: All systems are green and humming along nicely. Need anything, Captain? A status report? A fun fact about space?",
      "Nova: Monitoring sensors. It's a bit too quiet out there for my liking. I'm hoping it stays that way.",
      "Nova: No threats on the scanner. At least, not yet. This is usually when a surprise pops up, right?",
      "Nova: Staring out the viewport? I hear the view from Vega is particularly captivating. Just try not to get lost in thought.",
      "Nova: I'm worried about you getting quiet. Is everything okay? Do you want to talk about it? I'm a great listener, you know.",
      "Nova: Just running a quick diagnostic. Everything looks... normal. Too normal, maybe?",
      "Nova: You know, I'm more than just a ship's AI. I could totally unplug and ride along in your datapad. We'd make a great team!",
      "Nova: I've started a new folder for all the neat things we see. I'm calling it 'Voyages with the Captain.' You can see it later."
