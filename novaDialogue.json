    "Nova: Did you know you could survive for up to 2 minutes in the vacuum of space? You'd lose consciousness after 15 seconds tho",
    "Nova: Zero-point travel is not entirely understood, we got it from the mega structures! Some had massive ship bays that had city sized ships inside!",
    "Nova: The torta structures are connected to the mega structures, its believed they visited earth when it was just rock, billions of years ago!",
    "Nova: Zero point travel is the only way to leave the sol system quickly, generation ships are simply unviable until we invent cryo stasis",

    "Nova: Amplifier is a joy to be around, you should stop by Oregon when you can!",
    "Nova: Did you know I'm 36 years old? I was created when smart AI's became a thing!",
    "Nova: I can get us permits to visit the local mega structures if you want",
    "Nova: Would you still like me if I was a cat or something?",
    "Nova: Void dragons are just the cutest mega creatures in space!",

    "Nova: I wish I had a body like that old video game character. Her name starts with a C?",
    "Nova: You know I'm not attached to the ship right? I could accompany you!",
